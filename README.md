# Multi-Utility Toolkit (Python Project)

## Project Overview

**Multi-Utility Toolkit** is a menu-driven Python application that demonstrates the use of **built-in modules**, **custom modules**, and **modular programming**.
The program performs multiple utilities such as date & time operations, mathematical calculations, random data generation, UUID creation, and file handling.

## Features

*  Datetime & Time operations
*  Mathematical calculations
*  Random data generation (numbers, passwords, OTP)
*  UUID generator
*  File operations using a custom module
*  Module exploration using `dir()`
*  Menu-driven interface

## Modules Used

### Built-in Modules

* `datetime` – date and time operations
* `math` – mathematical calculations
* `random` – random values generation
* `uuid` – unique ID generation
* `time` – stopwatch and countdown timer

### Custom Module

* `file_module.py`

  * Create file
  * Write data
  * Read data
  * Append data

## How to Run

1. Open project folder in VS Code or terminal.
2. Make sure both files are in the same folder.
3. Run:

```
python main.py
```

## Concepts Covered

* Functions and menus
* Python modules and imports
* Custom module creation
* File handling
* `__name__ == "__main__"` usage
* `dir()` function exploration
* Modular programming

## Learning Outcome

This project helps understand how Python modules work together to build a structured and reusable application.
